# RadarChart
RadarChart Mathematica Package
The *RadarChart* mathematica package incorporates Radar Charts (also known as Spider Charts, Web Charts and Star Plots) as a new set of visualization tools into the mathematica environment.

A detailed explanation on the use of radar charts can be found in the following [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart).

Thanks to [halirutan](https://github.com/halirutan) for his guidance on setting up this project. Installation Instructions are heavily based on his existing projects.

## ![doc image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/erf8e.png) Detailed Usage
    RadarChart[{y1,y2,y3,...}]
generates a radar plot (also known as web, star, spider, cobweb or kiviat diagram) corresponding to a list of values. This type of chart is suitable for showing commonality and outliers across different variables. 
     RadarChart[{list1,list2,...}]
generates a radar plot to compare several series. 

     RadarChart[association]
generates a radar plot to view the variable values in an association. 

     RadarChart[{association1,association2,...}]
generates a radar plot to compare several series. 

     RadarChart[dataset]
generates a radar plot to compare several series.

The following table lists some of the most important options available.

Options | Values |Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
AxesType | "Star" or "Radar" | AxesType is an option for changing the style of the Axes. Star creates a Star Plot, while "Radar" a Radar Plot
FrameTicks    | Automatic          |Frameticks can be defined by the user. Example Frameticks->{0,2,4,6,8,10} 
PlotStyle | Automatic | PlotStyle is an option for plotting and related functions that specifies styles in which objects are to be drawn. 
Filling | None | defines what filling to add below lines.
ChartLegends | None or Automatic or list | ChartLegends is an option for charting functions that specifies what legends should be used for chart elements.
AxesLabel | None or Automatic or list | AxesLabel is an option for graphics functions that specifies labels for axes. 
PlotLabel | None | Defines the title of the plot.
Epilog | {} | Epilog is an option for graphics functions that gives a list of graphics primitives to be rendered after the main part of the graphics is rendered.  

## Examples
    Needs["RadarChart`"]
    RadarChart[{1, 2, 4, 5, 3}, 
    ChartLegends -> {"Private Label Strawberry Juice"}, 
    AxesLabel -> {"Ripe", "Green", "Candy", "Juicy", "Sulphur"}, 
    PlotLabel -> Style["Sensory Map Strawberry Juice", Bold, Large], 
    ImageSize -> Medium]
    
![Basic Example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Opnwp.png)    

Multiple Series can be charted.

     Needs["RadarChart`"]
     RadarChart[{{1, 4, 3, 5, 2}, {2, 4, 3, 2, 1}}, Filling -> Axis, 
         AxesLabel -> {"Sweet", "Sour", "Salty", "Bitter", "Umami"}, 
         PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}, ChartLegends -> {"Fernet-Cola", "Jugo"}]

Example of a start plot.

     Needs["RadarChart`"];
     RadarChart[{{1, 4, 3, 5, 2}, {2, 4, 3, 2, 1}}, AxesType -> "Star"]

Compare survey results.

     Needs["RadarChart`"];
     RadarChart[{{3, 4, 3, 4, 2}, {4, 5, 4, 5, 3}}, 
         AxesLabel -> {"Assets", "Reliability", "Cost Control", 
         "Abstenteeism", "Revenue"}, 
         ChartLegends -> {"Past Year", "Current Year"}, Filling -> Axis, 
         PlotStyle -> {{Gray}, {Black}}, ImageSize -> Medium]

## Neat Examples

Analyze and compare crime statistics across states.

     Needs["RadarChart`"];
     states = EntityClass["AdministrativeDivision", "AllUSStatesPlusDC"];
     stateNames = First@StringSplit[#, ","] & /@ states["Name"];
     crimeProps = {"AggravatedAssaultRate", "BurglaryRate", 
         "ForcibleRapeRate", "LarcenyTheftRate", 
         "MurderNonnegligentManslaughterRate", "PropertyCrimeRate", 
         "RobberyRate", "ViolentCrimeRate"};
     crimeData = EntityValue[states, 
         EntityProperty["AdministrativeDivision", #] & /@ crimeProps];
     crimeRanking = Transpose[
         Ordering[crimeData[[All, #]]] & /@ Range@Length@crimeProps];
     ds = Dataset[
         AssociationThread[stateNames, 
             AssociationThread[crimeProps, #] & /@ crimeRanking]];
     GraphicsRow[{RadarChart[ds["Georgia"], AxesType -> "Star", 
         PlotLabel -> Style["Georgia", Bold, Large], 
         Epilog -> {Dashed, Circle[{0, 0}, 25.5]}, ImageSize -> Large], 
         GraphicsGrid[
             Partition[
                 RadarChart[ds[#], PlotLabel -> #, AxesLabel -> None, 
                 PlotRange -> {0, 50}, AxesType -> "Star",
                 PlotRangePadding -> Full, FrameTicks -> None, 
                 Epilog -> {Dashed, Circle[{0, 0}, 25.5]}] & /@ stateNames, 
                 UpTo[6]], ImageSize -> 600]}]

# Installation

This package should work with Mathematica >8 if not using associations or datasets. The package was developed using mathematica 10.
The installation is simple: Copy the `RadarChart` package directory into a location where *Mathematica* can find it. Usually this is the `Applications` directory in your `$UserBaseDirectory`. Just evaluate

    FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]

to see it. If there is an old installation of the `RadarChart`, remove it. Please find detailed steps below.

### Automatic Installation for *Mathematica* 9 and above

We have set up [an installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catrasca/RadarChart/master/RadarChart/installer.m) that does all the steps, except deleting old installations, for you. If it finds an old installation, it will prompt you with the location and quit, so that you can remove the old installation. After removing the old files, just start it again and it will proceed through all the steps pointed out in the manual installation section. To start the installation script, simply call

    Import["http://tinyurl.com/ntmhkca"]

After this, the package should be available in your mathematica instance.

### Manual Installation

#### Removing old Installations

Old installation packages can be found by simply searching directories in your `$Path`. 

    FileNames["RadarChart", $Path]

Please remove old installation directories that appear after evaluating the commands above. You can use 

    DeleteDirectory[dir, DeleteContents -> True]

for that, but note that on Windows this might fail, because there, some files are locked when *Mathematica* is running. In this case, close *Mathematica* and do it manually using an explorer.

### Downloading, Extracting and Copying the New Version

The easiest way is, to download the whole repository as zip file. Use [this master.zip](https://github.com/catrasca/RadarChart/archive/master.zip) or click the *Download ZIP* on the right side on this page.

After you have downloaded the file extract it. If you have no tool for this on Windows, you could use the [free 7-Zip](http://7-zip.org/). Under Mac OSX and Linux this should work out of the box.

Inside the extracted directory, you will find a subdirectory `RadarChart` which has the following structure

    RadarChart/
    ├── Documentation
    │   └── English
    │       └── ReferencePages
    │           └── Symbols
    │               └── RadarChart.nb
    ├── Kernel
    │   └── init.m
    ├── Installer.m
    ├── pacletInfo.m
    ├── RadarChart.m

Copy the whole `RadarChart` directory with all its content to your `Applications` folder under your `$UserBaseDiretory`. If everything is in place proceed to the next step.

### Finishing the Installation

To make the package works, you can simply restart *Mathematica*.
